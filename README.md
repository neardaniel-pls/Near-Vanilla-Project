# **Near Vanilla Project 0.0.2**

## **Introduction**

Near Vanilla Project is a Skyrim modlist that intends to make Skyrim feel and work like a better version of itself without losing the "Skyrim" touch we all grew fond of.
These are the core ideas behind this modlist:

1. **Vanilla Feel.** I want everything to feel like it belongs in the base game. No new complicated systems or anything that requires a manual to understand. This is a simple modlist, you can experience the content as if it was always there.
2. **Stability.** This rule basically supersedes all the above. If a mod introduces major stability concerns it will be quickly cut.
3. **Beauty.** Skyrim but in 2021 with that next gen feel to it.
