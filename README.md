# **Near Vanilla Project**

## **Introduction**

Near Vanilla Project is a Skyrim modlist that intends to make Skyrim feel and work like a better version of itself without losing the "Skyrim" touch we all grew fond of.
These are the core ideas behind this modlist:

1. **Vanilla Feel.** I want everything to feel like it belongs in the base game. No new complicated systems or anything that requires a manual to understand. This is a simple modlist, you can experience the content as if it was always there.
2. **Stability.** This rule basically supersedes all the above. If a mod introduces major stability concerns it will be quickly cut.
3. **Beauty.** Skyrim but in 2021 with that next gen feel to it.

You can find the **full modlist** of Near Vanilla Project [here](https://github.com/neardaniel-pls/Near-Vanilla-Project/blob/main/modlist.md). If you feel like this modlist is for you, then go right ahead and click [here](https://github.com/neardaniel-pls/Near-Vanilla-Project/blob/main/installation-guide.md) to go straight to the **installation guide**.
However, if you want to know what I have changed over the past times feel free to check it out [here](https://github.com/neardaniel-pls/Near-Vanilla-Project/blob/main/changelog.md).

Thank you for the light read and have fun!

Best wishes,
